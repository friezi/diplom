  abstract =     "Most research in the area of publish/subscribe systems
                 has not considered fault-tolerance as a central design
                 issues. However, faults do obviously occur and masking
                 all faults is at least expensive if not impossible. A
                 potential alternative (or sensible supplementation) to
                 fault masking is self-stabilization which allows a
                 system to recover from arbitrary transient faults such
                 as memory perturbations, communication errors, and
                 process crashes with subsequent recoveries. In this
                 paper we discuss how publish/subscribe systems can be
                 made selfstabilizing by using self-stabilizing
                 content-based routing. When the time between
                 consecutive faults is long enough, corrupted parts of
                 the routing tables are removed, while correct parts are
                 refreshed in time, and missing parts are inserted. To
                 judge the eciency of self-stabilizing content-based
                 routing, we compare it to ooding, which is the nave
                 implementation of a self-stabilizing publish/subscribe
                 system. We show that our approach is superior to ooding
                 for a large range of practical settings.",
