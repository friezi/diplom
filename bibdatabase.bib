  abstract = {Most research in the area of publish/subscribe systems
	
	 has not considered fault-tolerance as a central design
	
	 issues. However, faults do obviously occur and masking
	
	 all faults is at least expensive if not impossible. A
	
	 potential alternative (or sensible supplementation) to
	
	 fault masking is self-stabilization which allows a
	
	 system to recover from arbitrary transient faults such
	
	 as memory perturbations, communication errors, and
	
	 process crashes with subsequent recoveries. In this
	
	 paper we discuss how publish/subscribe systems can be
	
	 made selfstabilizing by using self-stabilizing
	
	 content-based routing. When the time between
	
	 consecutive faults is long enough, corrupted parts of
	
	 the routing tables are removed, while correct parts are
	
	 refreshed in time, and missing parts are inserted. To
	
	 judge the eciency of self-stabilizing content-based
	
	 routing, we compare it to ooding, which is the nave
	
	 implementation of a self-stabilizing publish/subscribe
	
	 system. We show that our approach is superior to ooding
	
	 for a large range of practical settings.},
